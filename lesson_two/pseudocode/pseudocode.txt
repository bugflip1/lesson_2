given numbers a and b

calculate the sum 

return the sum

Formal 

Read a
Read b
sum = a + b
return sum

# new one 

given a list of strings

iterate through the list. adding each item to an initially empty string using the + for strings

return the final string 

# next

given a list of integers

iterate through each item
and somehow only add everyother item to a new list

iterate through the list,
every iteration check if a value is true or false
if true, add iterated item to list and toggle False
if false, toggle True

Formal

START 

# Given a list of integers

SET newlist = empty list
SET toggle = True

FOR every number in givenlist
    IF toggle is true
        append number to new list 
        Toggle = False
    ELSE
        toggle = True
return newlist

# find third of a given character

given a string and a character

replace the first 2 occurances of the character with spaces,
if the character is a space, change the replacement to a .
find the charcter in the string, if found, return indexm if not, return None. 

Formal

START 

# Given a string
# Given a character
SET replacer = ' '
IF character is ' '
    SET replacer = '.'

SET newstring = replace the first two occurances of character with replacer, assign to newstring

SET final = STRING.FIND character
IF final is -1
    RETURN None
ELSE 
    RETURN final

# merging lists 

given two lists of integers
merge them alternating form list one or two in the new list. 
return new list   

# mental model 2

Check if lists are empty.
Use a while loop with an explicit index variable.
Append from list1 first (ensures even index placement), then from list2 (ensures odd index placement).
Increment the index each loop.
Return the merged list at the end.

# Pseudocode

START 

# given list1 and list2

SET final = empty list
SET index = start index (0)

IF list1 is empty (check if falsy)
	return "ERROR: Lists cannot be empty"

WHILE INDEX < the length of list1
	append list1 at index to final
	append list2 at index to final
	increment index by 1

return final
